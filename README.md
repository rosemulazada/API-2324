## Introduction
For this assignment, we're tasked with designing solely for _one_ person. Now, in any other scenario, this would sound like a nightmare - what about accessibility? But there's a catch: the person we design for has some kind of disability, be it that they are blind or have motor problems. We have to design specifically suited to them and their needs. The entire minor is split up into three teams, each team representing one person. Our person is **Nicolette Besemer,** and she's the person for who we have to make, ironically, an _exclusive_ design, as dubbed by teacher Vasilis van Gemert.
