## Introduction

For this class, we were practically given free reign on what we wanted to do. We had to use at least one content based API and one Web API that was on the list on the MDN page. We also had to work out a detail page.

That was kind of it.

I had always wanted to make an application that gives you a recommended playlist based off your favorite songs, so this was what I set out to do! This for me was very awesome considering I had wanted to do this originally during my previous minor Information Design Tech but was too intimidated by the Spotify API (especially considering we only had a week and a half or so to create the entire app and had to learn a new framework..), so I'm very happy that I've done this now!

I ended up using three API's: Spotify Data API (oAuth/regular), the iFrame Embed API (also by Spotify) and Web Share API.

## Installation

Here are the steps to install my project.

1. Under the `Code` tab at the top.
2. Download this repository as a `.zip` file and unpack it.
3. Locate the folder `API-2324`
    - If you have `VS Code`: From here, all you need to do is open the folder in your editor and use the `Live Server` extension to start a local host. This allows you to also view the code and work more hands-on, should you desire.
    - If not, you can find the document on your device, navigate to the `index.html` file (this should be visible just by opening up `API-2324`), right-click it and open in a browser of your choosing. I've used Arc to test this project, so I can recommend these two - plus Safari or another browser that supports Web Share if you want to get into that. (_I've ommitted the share button in browsers that don't._)

If you'd like to try this out for yourself, you can try it out by visiting the link in the sidebar on the right!
